GIT GURUS GITSUB SITE
deployed through Netlify, a mock-up of Github. Includes an overview page, a repository page, a projects page, and a packages page. 

Description:
A general mock-up of a Github user page. Every page features a profile card with an image, a short description, and social media links to Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and TikTok. 
  The overview page contains pinned repositories, as well as a "pinned repo" form that allows the user to add to the pinned repository list. 

  The repos page contains repositories, a "create repo" form that allows the user to add to the repository list, as well as a search bar that filters through existing repositories. 

  The projects page contains a projects list, a "create new project" form that allows the user to add a new project to the existing projects list, as well as a search bar that filters through existing projects.

  The packages page contains a packages list, a "create new package" form that allows the user to add a new package to the existing packages list, and a search function that filters through existing packages. This page also allows for the user to delete packages.
